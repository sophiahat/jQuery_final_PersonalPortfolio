                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>This is my home page, the starting point for my website.  Here, you will find lots of information about my contributions to this society both big and small. The site is a work in progress, mostly documenting my professional development, career goals, along with my interests and observations.   I've spent all of my adult life as a musician, audio engineer and music educator.  Over the years I've picked up additional skills working with computers and have added web development and video production to my skillset.</p>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p> After graduating from Berklee College of Music with a bachelor's degree in music performance, I joined the US Air Force Band and spent 4 years travelling around the world on behalf of good ol' Uncle Sam. During my time in the service I matured as a performing musician and discovered my attraction to computers.  Part of my additional duty in the service was included creating music charts using music notation software.  Also, the Digital Audio Workstation was just coming into favor among independent musicians, and I found that part of the music business fascinating.  I also managed to get an MBA from Georgia College which helped me in my next chapter. </p>
                <p>My path my wife and I to Seattle, where I immediately began a career as a freelance musician and guitar instructor.  After a few years of teaching at local schools and colleges including the Seattle Drum School, Music Center of the Northwest, Edmonds Community College, Pacific Lutheran University and Cornish College of the Arts, I went back to school to study audio engineering from Shoreline Commmunity College and opened my own recording studio. Running a studio has helped me learn many of the markets involving audio production, including recording music, dialogue, sound design, and music composition. This year will mark the 15th year of operation of SophiaHat Studios</p>
                <h3>Today</h3>
                <p>Currently, I continue to explore related services including web development, game development, and video production as well as honing my craft in music composition. I've recently completed coursework in Python, Javascript, HTML5, CSS, and learned related technologies.  Also, I've began to understand audio middleware for games, Wwise and Fmod, as well as game development tools such as the Unreal Editor and Unity.  I hope to include more details on my latest skills in the near future.</p>
